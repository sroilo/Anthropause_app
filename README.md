# Abstract and rationale
The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically disrupted human activities across the globe, forcing over half of the global population into lockdown during spring 2020. Biodiversity data collection was impacted by the pandemic, too, as travel restrictions interrupted fieldwork campaigns and confined people at home. On the other hand, this global confinement also impacted the human experience of nature, and people spent more time observing other species. The Anthropause app constitutes the first global assessment of how the COVID-19 lockdown in spring 2020 impacted primary biodiversity data collection, using data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility to quantify changes in the number of collected records relative to pre-pandemic levels. The app is an open-source, interactive webtool which allows users to explore country-level data on the daily number of GBIF records collected during the pandemic, and to related them to human mobility data (i.e. percent change in visitors to parks and outdoor areas, percent change in time spent at home, from the Google Community Mobility Reports) and to the stringency of the countries’ pandemic policies (from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker by Hale et al. 2021).
